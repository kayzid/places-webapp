# PlacesWebapp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Notes    
Before running the the webapp please run the node js service which will serve up the places. 
Also the css implementation on the webapp is rudimentary. I have used angular flex and material ui. There is scope for further improvement of the overall design of the UI.
